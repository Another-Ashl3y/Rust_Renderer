# Rust_Renderer

A simple renderer



You have to use `cargo build` on yourself (or `cargo run`)
If you use `cargo run` then you need to have sdl2 properly installed (I think).
If you use `cargo build` then you can put the SDL2.dll file in the directory with the exe.
... maybe.

sdl2 -> https://www.libsdl.org/
